# Book-Your-Movie

Introduction
We enjoy going to the movies.But do you know how do you virtually select a Ticket and book it. How does it not show the seats which are booked? How does it cut cost according to certain scenarios for certain seats and rows? 
It would be interesting to mimic that. Isn’t it?
Let’s do it!!

Objective: Interaction
When someone run the main.py file of your Program. It should show this kind of interaction.
Ask the number of rows and seats per row and then show these 4 options until someone choose Exit:
1.Show the seats
2. Buy a Ticket
3. Statistics
4. Show booked Tickets User Info
0. Exit

1.Show the seats
A cinema Hall with 7 Rows and 8 seats per Row should look like this.
Notice that S shows the Vacant Seat here and the counting in the beginning of the row and column is just for reference to the seat number. 
1.Show the seats (contd.)
Reserved seat will show a B. Like here Seat at (Row No 3 ,Column 5th) is Booked.

2.Buy a Ticket
When someone buy a Ticket It should ask me row number and column number for the ticket someone booking.On the basis of the Rules it should show the Price for that seat and ask If someone want to book.
If someone choose Yes, it should take details of Name,Gender,Age and Phone No.
Finally It should print Booked Successfully.

3. Statistics
When someone choose the 3rd option for statistics.
It should show the following things:
Number of Purchased Tickets
Percentage of Tickets booked
Current Income
Total Income
The ticket price is determined by the following rules:
If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the rest 5 rows.

4. Show booked Tickets User Info
When someone choose the 4th option:
It should ask the row and col number.
If that row,col is booked show the Name,gender,age,Ticket Price and Phone No

Thank You !
